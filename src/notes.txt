Import components before using them from mat


- made service for getting weather
- imported it into the component
- made model for holding city info
- verified API call integrity
- next: form the api call properly and make it do it by itself. 
- next: Angular http call is returning undefined even though it is successful inside service
- try returning an observable & subscribe OR change the http method
